<< THE 40 WAYS WOMEN FAIL IN BED<BR>
<BR>
 1. MILKING IT: When stroking a guy's dick don't grab it like a bus rail and<BR>
 start jerking it like you were milking a cow. Don't use the penis as if<BR>
 it's a piece of gym equipment to strengthen the forearms. The male organ is<BR>
 a thing of wonder and beauty,and should be worshipped and held tenderly at<BR>
 all times.The sensitive part is at the top (where your face should be), not<BR>
 two-thirds of the way down.<BR>
<BR>
 2. LETHAL WEAPONS: A guy's scrotum is a wondrous aesthetic achievement of<BR>
 nature to be treated gently. Don't squeeze the balls like you are squeezing<BR>
 water from a sponge. If you have long nails pull them off with pliers<BR>
 before even looking at a guy's ball bag.<BR>
<BR>
 3. ROBOTS: When sucking a guy's dick don't just get on the end of the thing<BR>
 and jam your head back and forward. It's a beautiful instrument; it should<BR>
 be caressed, inspected, kissed and licked from every angle.<BR>
<BR>
 4. SILENT FRIGHT: If you've come and cannot be coerced to scream to show<BR>
 your appreciation, at least make some sort of sign to inform the guy that<BR>
 he's done his duty and can blow his biscuits whenever he wants.<BR>
<BR>
 5. PHONE TURN-Off: Don't put your mobile phone next to the bed and say:<BR>
 "I'm just waiting for a call from my hairdresser to confirm an appointment<BR>
 but we can carry on in the meantime." Ringing bells might have turned<BR>
 Quasimodo on but not your average stud with 10 pints of lager inside him.<BR>
<BR>
 6. NO LAUGHING MATTER: Don't laugh if your creative male lover gets carried<BR>
 away and says things like "Ride my hard cock you filthy cock-sucking slut"<BR>
 or "I want to rinse your mouth with my fresh, white love juice Laughter at<BR>
 any aspect of the male performance will not enhance it. Just be grateful<BR>
 you've got a guy who can speak whole sentences.<BR>
<BR>
 7. CLOSING UP: If a man is willing to take the trouble to come on your<BR>
 face, don't close your eyes. He wants you to share this ecstatic moment of<BR>
 joyful union with him. Semen is not likely to cause permanent blindness in<BR>
 most cases - but this is a risk you should be prepared to take for his<BR>
 happiness.<BR>
<BR>
 8. POOR PRESENTATION: Presentation is all important.Don't wait to be asked<BR>
 to get it doggy-style. Roll over and present. You know you love it.<BR>
<BR>
 9. HANGING AROUND: When he is done, you should not kiss and cuddle, he<BR>
 does<BR>
 not want to touch you. You should leave the bed and leave him in peace. If<BR>
 you are a one-night stand you should leave the premises with out Thieving<BR>
 anything or asking for a phone number.<BR>
<BR>
 10. BEING SHY: Always offer the Hershey Highway. You know you love It. If<BR>
 you don't like it that much, still offer it as you can quite easily play<BR>
 with yourself as he rams away.<BR>
<BR>
 11. BEING A DRIP: You always have tissues in your bag, use them to clean<BR>
 his sheets and any ball bag drippage if you have misbehaved and not<BR>
 swallowed everything.<BR>
<BR>
 12. LACK OF MAINTENANCE: Never ask a man if he likes your body as you will<BR>
 force him to lie. Men don't like fat chicks. Get in the gym and lose some<BR>
 weight and tighten those buns and thighs. There is no such thing as the<BR>
 perfect body. 99.6 per cent of men say that even Christy, Elle, Naomi et al<BR>
 could still lose a few pounds -so what chance have you got?<BR>
<BR>
 13. CLOCK-WATCHING: Never, ever, ever, ever even think of saying: "Are you<BR>
 going to come soon." If you're doing a blowie, you'd have to take your<BR>
 mouth off to utter the question. If you're giving a hand-job, you should<BR>
 have gone to the gym to work your biceps. Of he's shagging you and takes<BR>
 more than 10 minutes you should be grateful. This is not a time  trial but<BR>
 a blissful act of union between two sexually aware and gifted human beings.<BR>
<BR>
 14. FISHING FOR COMPLIMENTS: Don't ask him if you're the best lover he's<BR>
 ever had. Most men have had so many sexual partners that it is unlikely<BR>
 that you are. Please don't ask a man to lie about such an important thing.<BR>
<BR>
 15. PLAYING DEAD: Don't just lie there, do something. Good sex is not a<BR>
 spectator sport and it helps if both parties move around a bit. I know you<BR>
 expect the men to do all the hard and skillful work. We don't mind that and<BR>
 we're blessed with the equipment and know-how to do it but at least put<BR>
 some effort into the act to show your appreciation.<BR>
<BR>
 16. BEING POSSESSIVE: If you are lucky to have an imaginative lover who can<BR>
 satisfy two women at a time don't sneer at or reject his exciting<BR>
 suggestion that one of your friends joins you to make up a threesome. If<BR>
 he's a real man he's probably shagging her anyway. Plus you might learn<BR>
 something from her to keep your man really happy.<BR>
<BR>
 17. NOT KEEPING YOUR HAIR ON: Don't shave all your pubic hair off. It makes<BR>
 your pussy look like a piece of poultry past its sell-by date. At best, it<BR>
 looks like the snatch of a ten-year-old. If you want to trim, go for a nice<BR>
 sexy racing stripe in the manner favoured by the Playboy models that your<BR>
 man would rather be shagging.<BR>
<BR>
 18. SPITTING IT OUT: When a man has gone to so much trouble to ejaculate<BR>
 and get his aim right into your mouth, it is rude to spit it out without<BR>
 savouring the taste and gluey texture. You should play with semen like a<BR>
 block of Hubba Bubba, blowing bubbles, chewing and throwing from side to<BR>
 side. A line like "I love it when you come in my mouth" makes for a happy<BR>
 finale to fun and games.<BR>
<BR>
 19. INGRATITUDE: Never forget to thank a man for all the effort and energy<BR>
 he has expended on making love to you - especially if a) sex has lasted<BR>
 more than five minutes and/or b) you managed to achieve an orgasm. A man' s<BR>
 role in sex is far more demanding than a woman's so it is always nice when<BR>
 one's prowess is appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
 20. SEEKING FAVOURS: Never contemplate taking advantage of your man's<BR>
 warm<BR>
 after-sex glow to seek favours or make requests. As he drops off into<BR>
 well-deserved slumber, resist the urge to ask :"Do you think I should buy<BR>
 that dress/skirt/sofa/Mercedes/country cottage?" there is a name for the<BR>
 practice of mixing sex with material gain - prostitution.<BR>
<BR>
 21. BED-RIDDEN: Too many women fail in bed because they insist on being IN<BR>
 BED. Very few countries have statutes limiting horseplay to a designated<BR>
 room. Let yourself go with some sex in the study, bonking in the bathroom<BR>
 and kinkiness in the kitchen. If you're lucky, your man might imagine he's<BR>
 bonking someone sexy and adventurous and he might manage a larger,  harder<BR>
 erection.<BR>
<BR>
 22. SHARING NOT CARING: Whilst it is understandable that you would be<BR>
 excited after receiving a mouthful of cum, do not be thoughtless in<BR>
 expressing your gratitude by kissing your man on the lips. YOU like semen,<BR>
 HE doesn't. Be considerate, please.<BR>
<BR>
 23. BEING NAKED: Very few female bodies are good to look it so please make<BR>
 an effort to cover up as much as possible with exotic lingerie. Match the<BR>
 outfit to suit your bod. If you've got a half-decent ass but no tits for<BR>
 example, wear stockings and suspenders and cover your meagre mammaries<BR>
 with<BR>
 something silky.<BR>
<BR>
 24. TOO BRIGHT: If the man switches the light off, it is for a reason, so<BR>
 please don't insist on seeing what's going on. If he's got a bit of a beer<BR>
 belly or a lovebite from a bonk earlier that day, it is his right to keep<BR>
 such matters to himself. If he wants it dark so he can imagine he's<BR>
 shafting Natalie Imbruglia, please understand this fascinating aspect of<BR>
 the male psyche.<BR>
<BR>
 25. PLAYING THE NAME GAME (1) Never embarrass a gentleman by<BR>
 challenging<BR>
 him to remember your name after he's shagged you. If he thought it was<BR>
 important to remember your name, he would have.<BR>
<BR>
 26. PLAYING THE NAME GAME (2): Don't be angry if you're lover shouts out<BR>
 another woman's name during the sexual act. Men have much more complicated<BR>
 lives than women and deal with many more people at work, football club,<BR>
 gym, pub, etc. It's probably just a close associate and totally innocent.<BR>
 Of course, he might be shagging someone else in his spare time and it is<BR>
 understandable that he should make such an obvious mistake.<BR>
<BR>
 27. KEEPING HIM WAITING: Don't get him all turned on and the let his proud<BR>
 stiffy whither while you go to the bathroom and tone and moisturise every<BR>
 square centimetre of your body. The male erection can be sensitive to<BR>
 45-minute delays while you go off to make yourself look presentable. If you<BR>
 must follow a strict beauty regime, do it after he's shot his load and has<BR>
 started to snore.<BR>
<BR>
 28. TOOTH ACHE: When we ask you to eat our cock, this should not be taken<BR>
 literally. I know it's hard to resist but keep the tooth action to a little<BR>
 nibble now and again.<BR>
<BR>
 29. YOU CAN'T HURRY, LOVE: If a woman is serious about good oral sex as<BR>
 part of foreplay, 20 minutes is the bare minimum required to give the<BR>
 subtle and complex penis a reasonable working over. Better allow for 45<BR>
 minutes at least.<BR>
<BR>
 30. TWO DIMENSIONAL: It's not enough to be a specialist - even in the<BR>
 important skill of fellatio. To be regarded as a successful woman in bed<BR>
 you must have a full portfolio of tricks. These should include a penchant<BR>
 for facial glazing and a familiarity with idiosyncrasies of your man's anal<BR>
 region.<BR>
<BR>
 31. CAMERA SHY: If he wants to capture the beauty that is you during those<BR>
 special moments (so he can remember the bits he missed because he was<BR>
 drunk), help him by posing in a gorgeous, pouting way for the camera or<BR>
 video camera.<BR>
<BR>
 32. UNSWEET SMELL OF EXCESS: While men are more than happy to lick the<BR>
 pink<BR>
  clam, please give it a bit of a wash once or twice a week. You can have<BR>
 too much of a good thing.<BR>
<BR>
 33. OBSESSIVE: The female orgasm is over-rated so don't spoil everybody's<BR>
 fun by insisting on having one every time you have sex. Of course, if you<BR>
 do have lots, you should feel free to announce them.<BR>
<BR>
 34. PERIOD PAIN (1) : It's natural for a woman to beg for a good seeing to<BR>
 but please do not a) pretend your period has finished or b) that it hasn't<BR>
 even started. Just go without and let your man catch up with his fantasies<BR>
 about your friends, his young and pretty work colleagues and the girls he<BR>
 shagged before he met you.<BR>
<BR>
 35. PERIOD PAIN (2): Having said that (above), just because you're on the<BR>
 blob, it doesn't mean his natural and healthy urges have gone away. Don't<BR>
 put sex off limits for the duration of your period. Use this special time<BR>
 together to work on your oral and massage techniques.<BR>
<BR>
 36. THE BIG SWITCH (OFF): Nothing is worse than giving a man some<BR>
 encouragement and then not finishing the job. Such encouragement might be<BR>
 the slightest brush against any part of his body. So if he's got a stiffy,<BR>
 you've got to deal with it and take things through to their natural<BR>
 conclusion.<BR>
<BR>
 37. WAKE-UP CALLER: Men have busy and demanding schedules so please<BR>
 understand if he should occasionally (say three times a week) fall asleep<BR>
 while on the job. You should take it as a compliment that he feels so<BR>
 relaxed.<BR>
<BR>
 38. COVER UP: If you have lured a man to bed under the guise of being a<BR>
 sultry temptress with long eyelashes and painted lips, please keep the<BR>
 illusion going until he has discharged his porridge gun or fallen asleep.<BR>
 If you care about him, you will make sure he never discovers the  terrible<BR>
 secret hidden beneath your caked-on make-up.<BR>
<BR>
 39. PUTTING A DAMPENER ON THE EVENING: Don't make a fuss about<BR>
 sleeping on<BR>
 the damp patch. If God wanted men to sleep on the messy remains of coitus<BR>
 he would have given us a snatch.<BR>
<BR>
 40. TV SINNER: The only TV programs suitable for accompanying good sex<BR>
 are hardcore porn (especially involving yourself) or a football match. No<BR>
 gardening or knitting programs to be watched.<BR>
